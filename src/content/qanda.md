        "We recommend testing your water in ${city}, ${state} to understand how hard it truly is, its current pH level, and an overall insight and tarting point perspective on the situation. Water is neutral at a pH level of 7, while the best-tasting alkaline rinking water pH level is 9.5. Contact us today about our state-of-the-art reverse osmosis unit that will deliver he best-tasting drinking water for you and your family.",

        "Call us! Or simply submit an inquiry form on our website. We will contact you and set you up for a water test at your residence—completely free of charge!",

        "While city treatment facilities in ${city} do a fantastic job of ensuring bacteria are removed from treated water through the use of chlorine (and ometimes other chemical compounds like fluoride), the chemicals used begin to react with other substances already present in the water. These substances begin to react to the added cleaning chemicals, resulting in what is known as hard water. This water is not drinkable and is harsh on skin and hair.",

        "Our whole-house water filtration system in ${city}, ${shortState} uses salt and the highest-grade carbon in the form of tiny resin beads inside the tank to attract and hold onto hard water minerals. These beads then exchange those minerals for sodium ions (a process called ion exchange), ultimately creating soft water. This water is then pushed throughout your home to deliver to you and your family safe, non-toxic water for drinking and showering in.",

        "For optimal results, we recommend using any brand of extra-course water softener salt or pellet-type water softener salt. We do not recommend cube salt.",

        " We recommend checking the backlash tank every month or month and a half. Add one bag of salt as needed to keep the tank at least half full at all times. Ensure no “salt bridges” are forming and that the system’s meter says “softening” on the display meter.",

        "Our industry-leading, high-tech whole-house water filtration systems are designed for ${city}, ${shortState} Homes to be essentially hassle-free and as maintenance-free as possible. For optimal results, we recommend keeping the salt level in the brine tank at least half full. | For our reverse osmosis drinking systems, we recommend replacing the pre-carbon and post-carbon filters every 18–24 months and the reverse osmosis membrane every 3-5 years",
