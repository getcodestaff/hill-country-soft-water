Water Softeners sometimes need to be flushed and serviced to maintain the proper function. Depending on your model the manufacturers will request a service every 6 months to 2 years. The scope of a Water Softener Repair can vary. If you need your water softener tested to make sure it is working do not hesitate to contact one of our experts. A Water Softener Repair Man in the San Antonio Area will be glad to stop by. 

To keep your water softener healthy and need less maintenance you should make sure to keep the salt up to the desired height. If you system runs out of salt it will not be working properly. Some systems are self cleaning and some are not. Call today for a San Antonio Water Softener Expert.
