#  Why Should You Do Water Testing

In addition to the issues it causes with pipes and fixtures, hard water can also negatively impact your skin and hair. Hard water can dry out skin and hair, leaving them feeling dry and brittle. Installing a hard water system in your San Antonio home can help improve the quality of your water, resulting in softer skin and hair. Additionally, a hard water system can help prolong the lifespan of your home's appliances and reduce the need for frequent repairs due to mineral buildup.
