#  Windows

About 60% of the time, we discover dry rot or termite damage within the supporting wall of the windows. Most window installation companies are NOT licensed general contractors. They may not be licensed, bond and insured to handle the structural changes that need to take place to give you that awesome window project you were hoping for.
