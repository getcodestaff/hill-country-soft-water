#  Doors

We would like to think that all door contractors are the same. This is not the case. When this door project came to us, we were told that the wife had handmade custom side lights for their existing 1972 door system. Her husband then found and purchased a custom designed door for which he then placed it in the garage “while they got bids”.  They began looking for a door installer that could renovate the application and make use of what they had bought…..7 YEARS PRIOR TO MEETING US!!! They literally had over a dozen door companies come out to their home. None were willing to take on the project.
