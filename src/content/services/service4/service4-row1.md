#  Hard Water Filters for Homes

San Antonio is known for having hard water, which contains high levels of minerals such as calcium and magnesium. Hard water can cause a variety of issues, including scaling, staining, and reduced water flow in pipes and fixtures. If you have a well water system, you can install a hard water filter to remove minerals and soften the water. A professional plumber can help you choose the right filter for your well water system and install it correctly to ensure optimal performance.
