#  Doors

Not all houses have the same needs. Once in awhile we have a home that NO ONE IS WILLING to listen to the owners or offer solutions that give life time results. This home is a circa 1938 former business building that was converted to a home. The issue at hand is that the exterior walls were constructed of concrete filled cinder block!

 It had a glass door system for an entrance door that they wished to modernize to a regular door so the house could look like a home.  We were told they had gotten 10 contractors over the course of 12 years to their home.  No one was willing to offer a choice or offer a solution other than changing the glass to something “prettier”. Here the glass system is removed for inspection and assessment. A plan was made.
