#  Siding

We were asked to take a look at this home in Lincoln, CA in Placer County.  The sad story is the homeowners had hired a “siding contractor” in 2004 to install new siding to the home. The pitfall is that they did not take into consideration many aspects of the project that general contractors know to look for. For example, the siding contractor offered cheap siding made of MDF (a sawdust product). No seams were sealed, the vapor barrier was not extended under the gutter edges as it should have been, and the trim was never caulked or sealed.
