#  Siding

When you go about hiring a contractor to perform work on your home, DO NOT hire a handyman or and non-certified, not bonded, not insured contractor. Ask for references and be sure to check out information on google so you can ask questions. We are installing Hardie Plank with Hardie wrap vapor barrier, seam flanges, properly used spacers and caulking to seal all the trim stock. Results you can count on from a contractor who has over 60+ years of combined experience.
