#  Balconies

DO NOT let a none licensed and un-insured person build your balcony. Balconies HAVE TO BE ENGINEERED for the safety of the people using it and to protect your home! Not only do we design and build with wood products, we also offer and install sub-structures made with all steel construction!

For a great balcony, it is all about the sub-structure. Balconies have various uses and needs. Based on the requested quote, we gather all the pertinent information to arrive at an engineered design. Do NOT miss this step! Don’t let a contractor tell you they know what they will build if they do not have the right information and for sure…DO NOT hire a handyman to perform this task. Hire a contractor who is licensed, bonded, AND insured!
